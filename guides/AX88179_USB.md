# Make USB to Gigabit adapters based on the ASIX AX88179 chip work!

## The device
These are very popular with USB(-c) hubs that include an ethernet (gigabit) port. 
They are based around the ASIX AX88179 chip.

Examples of such hubs that have been tested by me and suffer from this issue are the following:
[UGREEN USB C Hub, USB C Hub Multiport Adapter with 4K 60Hz HDMI,100W Power Delivery, RJ45 Ethernet, 2 USB 3.0 5Gbps Data Ports, for MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, XPS, and More](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08HZ1GGH9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


Most USB(-c) to ethernet adapters (no HDMI) use the more common Realtek 8152 or 8153, which work perfectly out of the box. 
This guide is not for those adapters (since they work fine).

## The problem
Ethernet disconnects and reconnects all the time with output similar to this:

And the loop restarts.

This clearly makes the adapter completely unusable for ethernet use.

Althouth it's mentioned that kernels from 5.19 should
