# Make the X13 Yoga Gen3 Touchscreen identified by Gnome 45
This was done on Fedora 39, but should work for most other Gnome based distributions.

## Identify the issue
Opening Gnome Settings under "Wacom Tablet" shows "No tablet Detected".

This can be confirmed by issuing
~~~
otheos@weywot:~$ libwacom-list-local-devices 
/dev/input/event7 is a tablet but not supported by libwacom
Failed to find any devices known to libwacom
~~~

The issue remains even after updating libwacom devices with ```sudo libwacom-update-db".

## Identify the device ID
The problem is that ```libwacom``` doesn't have a descriptor for the specific device. 
So let's find the device.

I use my **ThinkPad X13 Yoga Gen3** for this.

~~~
otheos@weywot:~$ sudo dmesg | grep Wacom
[    2.768120] input: Wacom HID 5284 Pen as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.1/i2c_designware.1/i2c-1/i2c-WACF2200:00/0018:056A:5284.0002/input/input17
[    2.768760] input: Wacom HID 5284 Finger as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.1/i2c_designware.1/i2c-1/i2c-WACF2200:00/0018:056A:5284.0002/input/input18
~~~

The touchscreen device is a WACF2200 (supported) with an id of **056A:5284**.

## Create the file for libwacom to identify the touchscreen
These files are in ```/usr/share/libwacom```.

Doing a quick ```ls``` in that folder shows many files named ```isdv4-XXXX.tablet```. 
The ```XXXX``` part is the device ID, in our case ```5284```. 

As of this writing there is **no*** ```isdv4-5284.tablet``` file.
There **is** however a file named ```isdv4-5285.tablet``` which looks very close to what we want. 

It looks like this:
~~~
# Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Yoga Gen 2
# Sensor Type: AES
# Features: Touch (Integrated), Tilt
# HW Resolution: 28604 x 17878 (2540 x 2540 lpi)
#
# Autogenerated from sysinfo.AP2hbJxj8g
# https://github.com/linuxwacom/wacom-hid-descriptors/issues/188#issue-1096423544

[Device]
Name=ISDv4 5285
ModelName=
DeviceMatch=i2c:056a:5285
Class=ISDV4
Width=11
Height=7
IntegratedIn=Display;System
Styli=@isdv4-aes;

[Features]
Stylus=true
Touch=true
~~~

It is clear this is for the **Gen 2** X13, so the touchscreen devices are (probably) the same with different device numbers.

So let's make a copy:
~~~
otheos@weywot:~$ sudo su
root@weywot:/home/otheos# cd /usr/share/libwacom/
root@weywot:/usr/share/libwacom# cp isdv4-5285.tablet isdv4-5284.tablet
~~~

Now let's edit the new file:
~~~
# Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Yoga Gen 3
# Sensor Type: AES
# Features: Touch (Integrated), Tilt
# HW Resolution: 28604 x 17878 (2540 x 2540 lpi)
#
# Autogenerated from sysinfo.AP2hbJxj8g
# https://github.com/linuxwacom/wacom-hid-descriptors/issues/188#issue-10964235>


[Device]
Name=Wacom 5285	- ThinkPad X13 Yoga Gen	3
ModelName=WACF2200
DeviceMatch=i2c:056a:5285
Class=ISDV4
Width=11

IntegratedIn=Display;System
Styli=@isdv4-aes;

~~~

Reboot.
